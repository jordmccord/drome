## Introduction

Drome project is my try to create JavaScript task runner which would be easy to use, lightweight, powerful and with well maintained ecosystem.

## Features

- **Minimal abstraction:** You can define tasks with command line statements and Node.js APIs
- **Independent:** Drome doesn't have dependencies - it's really light and can grow up in his own way
- **Plug & play:** All Node packages are Drome ecosystem - you don't have to wait for plugin updates
